❓Common Questions About Our Bot

1. Can the bot claim all codes without missing any?
✅ Yes, as long as the code is valid and you're properly connected. We’ve optimized everything for speed and reliability. But as with anything, small human/setup errors can still happen. Our current success rate is 99.99%, and we continue to improve.

2. What makes this bot better than others? 
🔥 We are transparent, with zero hidden tactics.  

💸 Our pricing is the most flexible and probably the cheapest, with free credits for first-time users, top-up bonuses, and discounts for high-volume users. 

👀 Other bots might sell and disappear — we monitor every drop and even provide compensation when something goes wrong. 

💬 We have a public group for discussion — no hidden support, no silence. Everything is shared, well-maintained, and open.  

⚙️ We offer multiple setup options, from SmartClaim 2.0 to 3.0 with API and cloud support. Perfect for both casual and advanced users.

3. Is this bot anti code-ban? 
⚠️ No bot can guarantee that. Our bot works like a normal user, just faster and more efficient. There’s no secret trick to avoid ban, and any bot claiming 100% anti-ban is likely not telling the full truth. Be cautious.


4. ❗️Final reminder:
If any bot claims “100% success rate and anti-ban,” it’s likely just marketing fluff, you should be caution, that's too good to be true. We keep things real and deliver what’s promised.

  
🧠 Let the bot do the hard work. You just chill and watch the codes roll in. 😎
